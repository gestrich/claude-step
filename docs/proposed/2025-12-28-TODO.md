# TODO

## V1

- [ ] **Customize Tool Configuration**

User should be able to set allowed tools in workflows and override for projects in the configuration yaml.

- [ ] **Fix currency formatting**

In various cost outputs, drop parts after cents 0.12xxxx

- [ ] **Cost Control**

Explore how to avoid runaway costs from either jobs taking to long or too many PRs opening. Consider having a max

- [ ] **Setting on Name**

Settle on a good app name

- [ ] **Publish README & Linked Docs**

Create informative documentation that explains the tool and curent limitations.

- [ ] **Record internal video walkthrough**

Create "ClaudeStep" tutorial video.

## V2

- [ ] **Write blog post**

Written guide explaining the approach.

- [ ] **Allow any path for spec file**

See pending proposal. Need to think about it.

- [ ] **Support Slack Override in Config**

This is important if different teams want their slack notifications for large codebases.

- [ ] **Support downlaoding specific tools**

Some claude commands require tools like swiftlint. Need to consider how to support this. Can a bash script downlaod tools?

- [ ] **Support Non-AI Refactors**

Consider allowing a bash script to run to refactor as well.

- [ ] **Support PR Updates with Comment**

Allow user to comment on PR. The comments could trigger a workflow that runs Claude on the genrated PR, with all he context and apply the user's feedback. Note this can be done already with Claude code action so need to consider the value add.

- [ ] AI Retry on Failed Builds

If tests fail on CI after AI generated code, the AI could try to fix it up to N times.

- [ ] **Auto-Reviewer Assignment**

The reviewer can be inferred from the PR creator. Subsequent PRs can infer it from the prior PR.

- [ ] **Allow Local Claude Runs**

It could save considerable $ to use your own claude subscription rather than tokens.

- [ ] **Local Build Script**

Fetch open PRs and build locally on a schedule. Ready to run when you sit down to review.

- [ ] **UI Automation Screenshots**

Capture screenshots showing the result. Visual verification without manual testing.

- [ ] Support additional claude mentions in PR

Use Claude Code mentions to update the PR

- [ ] Explore using GH issues to store tasks

Pros
* Single source of truth for status and things
* Easier to find status
* Can edit outside PRs (completing tasks)
* Maybe config can be eliminated

Cons
* Work defined outside repo
* Strict structure required in unexpected place (GH issue)
