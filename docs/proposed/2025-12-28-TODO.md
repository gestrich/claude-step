# TODO

- [ ] **Add workflow examples to docs the user can just copy over**

- [ ] **Fail action if any step fails**

- [ ] **Scheduled PR Creation** (see [2026-01-03-2-scheduled-pr-creation.md](./2026-01-03-2-scheduled-pr-creation.md))

New action/command to open PRs for projects with available capacity:

* Runs on schedule (e.g., daily)
* Discovers all projects, checks capacity
* Opens PRs for any project with remaining tasks and available capacity
* Ensures projects don't stall if first trigger was missed

- [ ] **Publish README & Linked Docs**

Create informative documentation that explains the tool and curent limitations.

- [ ] **Record internal video walkthrough**

Create "ClaudeChain" tutorial video.

- [ ] **Cost Control**

Explore how to avoid runaway costs from either jobs taking to long or too many PRs opening. Consider having a max

- [ ] **PR titles should include project name**

- [ ] **Statistics in GH Summary should include cost per PR**

Also make a markdown grid.

- [ ] **Statistics in GH Summary should include disclaimer regarding orphaned PRs**

- [ ] **Use Phase or Step consistently in Docs**

- [ ] **When No PRs open Slack should explain how to trigger**

- [ ] **Bad Permission Error Feedback**

I had bad Github workflow permissions for the statitics workflow. I did not put the PR read permission (docs added for this here c049b579de55496ba20448e4387f395292b64d72). We need better feedback when the gh command fails.

- [ ] **Support AI Summary in PR Summary**

Support a {AI SUMMARY} placeholder in PR summaries, instead of using PR comments.

- [ ] **Trigger workflow off changes to .github/workflow/<relevant workflow files>**

- [ ] **Write blog post**

Written guide explaining the approach.

- [ ] **Allow any path for spec file**

See pending proposal. Need to think about it.

- [ ] **Support chainging spec files**

Consider when one spec file is done, you may want to stage ANTOHER PR to another branch (i.e. to main). Consider having another configuration option like completionBranch for project configs.

- [ ] **Show repository name in Notifcations**

- [ ] **Show PR links in Statistics summary**

- [ ] **Support Slack Override in Config**

This is important if different teams want their slack notifications for large codebases.

- [ ] **Support downlaoding specific tools**

Some claude commands require tools like swiftlint. Need to consider how to support this. Can a bash script downlaod tools?

- [ ] **Support Non-AI Refactors**

Consider allowing a bash script to run to refactor as well.

- [ ] **Support PR Updates with Comment**

Allow user to comment on PR. The comments could trigger a workflow that runs Claude on the genrated PR, with all he context and apply the user's feedback. Note this can be done already with Claude code action so need to consider the value add.

- [ ] AI Retry on Failed Builds

If tests fail on CI after AI generated code, the AI could try to fix it up to N times.

- [ ] **Auto-Reviewer Assignment**

The reviewer can be inferred from the PR creator. Subsequent PRs can infer it from the prior PR.

- [ ] **Allow Local Claude Runs**

It could save considerable $ to use your own claude subscription rather than tokens. Could run as a cron.

- [ ] **Local Build Script**

Fetch open PRs and build locally on a schedule. Ready to run when you sit down to review.

- [ ] **UI Automation Screenshots**

Capture screenshots showing the result. Visual verification without manual testing.

- [ ] Support additional claude mentions in PR

Use Claude Code mentions to update the PR

- [ ] Explore using GH issues to store tasks

Pros
* Single source of truth for status and things
* Easier to find status
* Can edit outside PRs (completing tasks)
* Maybe config can be eliminated

Cons
* Work defined outside repo
* Strict structure required in unexpected place (GH issue)
