# TODO

## Easy

- [ ] **Add trigger instructions when no PRs are open**

When statistics show no open PRs for a project that has remaining tasks, users may not know how to trigger the next PR creation. The Slack message should include helpful guidance like: "Trigger: Run the ClaudeChain workflow manually or push to the spec branch"

- [ ] **Standardize Phase vs Step terminology in docs**

Documentation inconsistently uses "Phase" and "Step" to describe stages of work. Use "Phase" for spec.md task groupings (already established pattern). Keep "step" for GitHub Action steps (different context).

- [ ] **Fail action if any step fails**

- [ ] **Bad Permission Error Feedback**

I had bad Github workflow permissions for the statitics workflow. I did not put the PR read permission (docs added for this here c049b579de55496ba20448e4387f395292b64d72). We need better feedback when the gh command fails.

- [ ] **Record video walkthrough**

Create "ClaudeChain" tutorial video.

- [ ] **Write blog post**

Written guide explaining the approach.

- [ ] **Show closed/rejected PR stats in costs**

Include both open and closed (rejected) PR statistics in cost reporting.

- [ ] **Investigate Claude Code features in CI environment**

Test what Claude Code features work in the automated GitHub Actions environment using a small sample repo. Investigate:
- Custom tools - do they work?
- Skills - are they available?
- Slash commands - verify they don't work (suspected)
- Permissions and prompts behavior

## Medium

- [ ] **Gracefully handle first Merge**

The first merge is tricky as you need to merge into the source branch. But it is easiest to push your spec to that branch (no PR). This requires the manual workflow to be triggered which is cumbersome. Look into push triggers again as that may be the best solution.

- [ ] **Limit Statistics to Active Projects**

When generating statitics, first only look at PRs with claudechain labels in the last 30 days. Then for all of the associated projects, do the reporting (even on the project PRs > 30 days). This will avoid reporting on stale projects helping with statistics performance.

- [ ] **Cost Control**

Explore how to avoid runaway costs from either jobs taking to long or too many PRs opening. Consider having a max

- [ ] **Support AI Summary in PR Summary**

Support a {AI SUMMARY} placeholder in PR summaries, instead of using PR comments.

- [ ] **Allow any path for spec file**

See pending proposal. Need to think about it.

- [ ] **Support downloading specific tools**

Some claude commands require tools like swiftlint. Need to consider how to support this. Can a bash script download tools?

- [ ] **Support Non-AI Refactors**

Consider allowing a bash script to run to refactor as well.

- [ ] **Auto-Reviewer Assignment**

The reviewer can be inferred from the PR creator. Subsequent PRs can infer it from the prior PR.

- [ ] **Local Build Script**

Fetch open PRs and build locally on a schedule. Ready to run when you sit down to review.

- [ ] **Slack celebration message on PR merge**

Post a Slack message with a celebration emoji when a PR is merged.

- [ ] **Show task chain on merge**

Reinforce the "chains" concept by visually linking merged tasks to the next task. Something like: `[Merged Task] 🔗 [Next Task]` to show the chain progressing.

- [ ] **Support multi-step script/prompt sequences**

Allow users to define multiple scripts and prompts with a suffix schema (e.g., `script-1`, `prompt-1`, `script-2`, `prompt-2`, ... `prompt-10`). These would be dropped into the project directory and executed in order, enabling multiple independent scripts and prompts to run sequentially to complete a single task.

## Hard

- [ ] **Scheduled PR Creation** (see [2026-01-03-2-scheduled-pr-creation.md](./2026-01-03-2-scheduled-pr-creation.md))

New action/command to open PRs for projects with available capacity:

* Runs on schedule (e.g., daily)
* Discovers all projects, checks capacity
* Opens PRs for any project with remaining tasks and available capacity
* Ensures projects don't stall if first trigger was missed

- [ ] **Support chaining spec files**

Consider when one spec file is done, you may want to stage ANOTHER PR to another branch (i.e. to main). Consider having another configuration option like completionBranch for project configs.

- [ ] **Support PR Updates with Comment**

Allow user to comment on PR. The comments could trigger a workflow that runs Claude on the genrated PR, with all he context and apply the user's feedback. Note this can be done already with Claude code action so need to consider the value add.

- [ ] **AI Retry on Failed Builds**

If tests fail on CI after AI generated code, the AI could try to fix it up to N times.

- [ ] **Allow Local Claude Runs**

It could save considerable $ to use your own claude subscription rather than tokens. Could run as a cron.

- [ ] **UI Automation Screenshots**

Capture screenshots showing the result. Visual verification without manual testing.

- [ ] **Support additional claude mentions in PR**

Use Claude Code mentions to update the PR

- [ ] **Explore using GH issues to store tasks**

Pros
* Single source of truth for status and things
* Easier to find status
* Can edit outside PRs (completing tasks)
* Maybe config can be eliminated

Cons
* Work defined outside repo
* Strict structure required in unexpected place (GH issue)
