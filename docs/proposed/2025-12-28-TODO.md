# TODO

## V1

- [ ] **Cost is Inaccurate**

The cost appears to show the sonnet model cost, even though Haiku used. Need to research any open issues on cost reporting. Possibly could have the user add a "cost map" that includes cost for different models and we parse total tokens used instead.

- [ ] - [ ] **Make config files optional**

The config files should be optional.

- [ ] **Allow any path for spec file**

- [ ] **The discovery action may not be used currently**

- [ ] **Secure Secrets**

- Confirm secure approach for Claude token Actions
- Confirm secure approach for webhooks (secrets?)

- [ ] **Cost Control**

Explore how to avoid runaway costs from either jobs taking to long or too many PRs opening. Consider having a max

- [ ] **Record video walkthrough**

Create "ClaudeStep" tutorial video.

- [ ] **Write blog post**

Written guide explaining the approach.

## V2

- [ ] **Support PR Updates with Comment**

Allow user to comment on PR. The comments could trigger a workflow that runs Claude on the genrated PR, with all he context and apply the user's feedback. Note this can be done already with Claude code action so need to consider the value add.

- [ ] AI Retry on Failed Builds

If tests fail on CI after AI generated code, the AI could try to fix it up to N times.

- [ ] **Allow Local Claude Runs**

It could save considerable $ to use your own claude subscription rather than tokens.

- [ ] **Local Build Script**

Fetch open PRs and build locally on a schedule. Ready to run when you sit down to review.

- [ ] **UI Automation Screenshots**

Capture screenshots showing the result. Visual verification without manual testing.

- [ ] Support additional claude mentions in PR

Use Claude Code mentions to update the PR

- [ ] Explore using GH issues to store tasks

Pros
* Single source of truth for status and things
* Easier to find status
* Can edit outside PRs (completing tasks)
* Maybe config can be eliminated

Cons
* Work defined outside repo
* Strict structure required in unexpected place (GH issue)
