## Writing Feature Guides

When creating user-facing documentation:
- Focus on **what** users can do and **how** to do it
- Use practical examples and real-world scenarios
- Avoid implementation details unless necessary for understanding
- Include clear step-by-step instructions
- Add troubleshooting sections where appropriate

For technical details about how features work internally, create a corresponding document in [feature-architecture](../feature-architecture/).
